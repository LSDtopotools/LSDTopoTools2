Welcome to *LSDTopoTools 2.x*

Here we will be updating *LSDTopoTools* so it: 

. Runs from command line (like GDAL)
. Has conda recipies so you can just `conda install lsdtopotools` and get going. 
. Have it set up for Docker so that you can just `docker pull lsdtopotools` and get going. 
. Have all the driver functions set up to use the same syntax and gathered in the same place. 

We are currently in beta version so stay tuned to this repository as we update the various recipies and driver functions.
