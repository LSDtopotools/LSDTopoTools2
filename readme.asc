== Basic instructions

. Clone the repository.
. Run:
+
[source,console]
----
$ sh lsdtt2_setup.sh
----
+
. Now you can run the programs from within your terminal system. 

=== Alternative method (but `lsdtt2_setup.sh` is easier)

. Clone the repository.
. Go into the `src` directory.
. Run
+
[source,console]
----
$ sh build.sh
----
+
. This compiles the source code. The programs will be moved into the `bin` directory. To make these accessible from anywhere in your current terminal session, you need to:
.. Go into the main repository directory (if you are in `src`, then use `cd ..`).
.. Run: 
+
[source,console]
----
$ sh lsdtt2_terminal.sh
----
+


== Future plans

Welcome to *LSDTopoTools 2.x*



Here we will be updating *LSDTopoTools* so it: 

. Runs from command line (like GDAL)
. Has conda recipies so you can just `conda install lsdtopotools` and get going. 
. Have it set up for Docker so that you can just `docker pull lsdtopotools` and get going. 
. Have all the driver functions set up to use the same syntax and gathered in the same place. 

We are currently in beta version so stay tuned to this repository as we update the various recipies and driver functions.
