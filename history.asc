= History

== 0.1 (2018-13-12)


* First beta release

== 0.2 (2020-22-04)

* New routines for analysing concavity index
* Adding new routines for CAIRN

== 0.3 (2020-22-04)

* More updates to the concavity routines
* Some updates to source code of MuddPILE including 3D lithology
* adding functionality to CAIRN so you can calculate without topographic shielding

== 0.4 (2021-03-21)

* Fixes a bug in the geojson printing that caused later versions of QGIS to reject the geojson files.
* Includes much more functionality on the hillslope flow routing routines including better coverage of the ridgetops, easier selections of basins and lower memory use
* Adds a swath mapping tool that does not depend on the point cloud library (meaning that the terrace and floodplain code may become available here in the next release).
* And some other minor bug fixes and efficiencies.

== 0.5 (2021-12-17)

* This update provides some improvements to the floodplain extraction algorithms.
* In addition there are some new features in basic metrics for raster manipulation.

* We have also included help and version flags to the command line tools.
* If you call a command line tool with the flag -h then you will produce a csv explaining all the options for each tool.

== 0.6 (2020-09-03)

== 0.7 (2022-09-13)

* This includes a number of improvements to the valley width extraction algorithms including those used in the paper https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-10-437-2022
* This release has a new dependency on the OpenCV library. The programs will compile without this library but the valley metrics component will only compile with OpenCV.
* This version removed dependency on the Point Cloud Library.
* It also includes updated functionality for the cosmogenic tools, so the analyses from the CAIRN (Mudd et al 2016) method are streamlined.

== 0.8 (2023-05-03)

* New contributions from SMM and FJC
* Additions to channel extraction include getting longest channel, including more information in the output files, and an option to print channels as shapefiles. 
* A number of changes to the cosmo tool including better accounting for a column, an interface to bring in transient erosion rates, better support for CRN, smoother operation of the nesting functions, and fixes to the shielding calculations that allow you to compute erosion rates in one step. 
* Added a function for creating steady state fluvial landscapes
* Included some new metrics, most notably the normalised concavity index or NCI that was used in Chen et al Nature paper. 
* Added a routine that facilitates tagging of major drainage divides.
* Added perona-malik filter to hillslope analysis
* added a small function to analyse channel tips for a channel extraction routine
* Other minor bug and typo fixes.
